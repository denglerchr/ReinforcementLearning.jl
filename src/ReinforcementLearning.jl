# Provide standard reinforcement learning algorithms for (until now) continuous state and action spaces.
# The code is based on the Knet and AutoGrad module for computing the gradients.
# The main structs are:
# 1. The "Environment" struct, see ?Environment
# 2. The "Policy" struct. Some algorithms also accept recurrent policies or GPU training.
# 3. The struct defining the algorithm and its hyperparameters
#   3.1 "Reinforce" struct for the reinforce algorithm
#   3.2 "PPO" struct for the PPO algorithm
#
# If all those structs are defined, you can start optimizing by calling
# optimize!(algo, policy, environment), which returns the average
